# Learning Stats and Econometrics with python

This is the third of a series of Jupyter Notebooks that I am coding as I relearn econometrics and use python to carry out the analysis.

I am mainly doing this using the INCREDIBLE youtube series made by Ben Lambert. This is problem set one which can be found in the first part of Ben's undergraduate econometrics syllabus on youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwJRxp3blEvZyQBTTOMFRP_TDaSdly3gU

Seriously its very good, when I studied economics at uni I found econometrics very difficult. But the way Ben articulates the concepts makes it much easier to understand.

I will be annotating these note books to explain what I am doing and what the findings are of them as I go along.

Hope anyone reading this find this notebook helpful.
